Check ls /dev/tty* to note the tty port of the arduino. It is subject to change on every unplug.
Replace teh tty port in the python files on the pi side

rpi_read and serail_2_pi.ino will let the arduino send a string of data continously to the pi and the pi prints on the STD output.

rpi_read_2 and pi_2_serial.ino will let both arduino and pi communicate with eachother and all the transactions will printed on the STD output.

This is from a tutorial but had synch issues. The data was sent but they were not printed on the STDO. The problem in on the arduino side code.
There is only one serial port for tx and rx. So bytes that were sent out from arduino were picked up the Serial.available as if they were the incomming bytes.

After making some changes it works well. But still care has to be taken to avoid that from happening.

Input buffer should be flushed on every loop. flush() will wait for outgoing transmissions but not the incomming ones.
