The google speech python client works only for raw format files
Sox can be used to convert a wav file to raw format, No issues with this so far. The following is the command

sox audio.wav -c 1 -r 16000 -b 16 audio.raw

Synch is for short audio files and asynch has to be used to transcribe long audio files
