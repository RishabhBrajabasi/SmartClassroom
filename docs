The google speech python client works only for raw format files
Sox can be used to convert a wav file to raw format, No issues with this so far. The following is the command

sox audio.wav -c 1 -r 16000 -b 16 audio.raw

Synch is for short audio files and asynch has to be used to transcribe long audio files

To convert mp3 to raw we must first convert it into wav using the command

ffmpeg -i audio.mp3 "audio.wav"

To record audio from webcam directly into raw file:
sudo arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 out.raw

Real-time streaming works but there are a few issues using that - Same phrase gets repeated many times.
